# pseudartabas

In his comedy _Acharnenses_, Aristophanes has the Persion Ψευδαρτάβας speak before the Athenian assembly and say:
```
ἰαρταμὰν ἐξάρξαν ἀπισσόνα σάτρα.
```
What's remarkable is that only can this pseudo-Persian gibberish[^1] be scanned as a perfectly well-formed iambic trimeter, but


```
Ψευδαρτάβας: ἰαρταμὰν ἐξάρξαν ἀπισσόνα σάτρα.
```

[^1]: Some editors divide it into `ἰαρταμὰν ἐξάρξαν ἀπισσόνα σάτρα' (Hall & Geldard 1907) or [`ἰαρταμὰν ἐξάρξ' ἀναπισσόνα σάτρα'](https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0240%3Acard%3D100) to tease out pseudo-Greek syntax, which is another fun. A prosodist can only comment that since the trimeter tends to have either a penthemimeral or hepthemimeral caesura, and if not then at least a trithemimeral, the former would be unusual.
